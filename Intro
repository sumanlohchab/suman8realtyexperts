Welcome to my website 
Greetings, I’m Suman. I’m a realtor living in Toronto, ON.
As a highly educated and multi-talented individual, I have achieved a great deal in both the fields of psychology and law. With a PhD. in psychology and experience working as a lawyer in the Supreme Court of India, I have developed a strong understanding of human behavior and the legal system.
In addition to my academic and professional achievements, I have also ventured into the world of real estate. Over the past two years, I have gained experience in preconstruction, resale, and land development. This has allowed me to expand my skill set and explore new opportunities.
Overall, I am a driven and ambitious individual who is constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities for growth. I am passionate about using my knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in the world, and I am excited to see where my journey will take me next.
